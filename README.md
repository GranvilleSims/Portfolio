# About Me

A simple website about me, some samples of my work, and contact information.  




Samples of my work include:


A Weather Application that allows the user to search on a city, and receive a 5-day forecast for that city.  The app also retains recent searches in local storage.

A Day Planner Application that allows the user to store events on an hourly day planner, which get stored in local storage.

A News Application that I participated in making with a team of developers.  The app allows the user to search on a topic, then the app returns headlines from both The Guardian news source and the New York Times, side-by-side.  The purpose of the app is to allow users to compare the news coverage of topics by the two sources.
